 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.797   TIME= 19:42:48
 Element shape checking is currently inactive.  Issue SHPP,ON or         
 SHPP,WARN to reactivate, if desired.                                    

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.828   TIME= 19:42:48
 Material number 9 (used by element 15187) should normally have at least 
 one MP or one TB type command associated with it.  Output of energy by  
 material may not be available.                                          

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.562   TIME= 19:42:49
 For element 15187 the element connectivity is 0 and 19294.  The node    
 which is identified as a 0 will be a grounded node.                     

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.562   TIME= 19:42:49
 For element 15188 the element connectivity is 0 and 19296.  The node    
 which is identified as a 0 will be a grounded node.                     

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.578   TIME= 19:42:49
 The sparse solver must be used if any current technology elements with  
 u-P formulation or MPC184 elements using Lagrangian multiplier          
 entangle with other contraint equtions.  The equation solver option     
 has been switched to the sparse solver.                                 

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.734   TIME= 19:42:49
 For element 15187 the element connectivity is 0 and 19294.  The node    
 which is identified as a 0 will be a grounded node.                     

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       2.062   TIME= 19:42:49
 For element 15188 the element connectivity is 0 and 19296.  The node    
 which is identified as a 0 will be a grounded node.                     

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       2.062   TIME= 19:42:49
 Coefficient ratio exceeds 1.0e8 - Check results.                        

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       2.391   TIME= 19:42:49
 Pivoting has been activated for the Distributed Sparse Matrix Solver .  
 The memory required may greatly exceed the predicted amount.  In that   
 event, use the DSPOPTION command to change the memory mode and/or       
 memory size used by the Distributed Sparse Matrix Solver.               

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =      98.375   TIME= 19:44:33
 Contact element 15452 (real ID 3) status changes abruptly from          
 no-contact -> contact (with target element 15693).
